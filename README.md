# What is my Discord ID?

This is a simple bot designed to assist mobile users in finding their identifier on the [Discord platform](https://discordapp.com). It came about [within a Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/9phixm/discord_wants_to_sell_your_data_and_if_that_data/e82rk8d/) discussing some changes to Discord.  

Usage is pretty simple... you simply [join the provided Discord guild](https://discord.gg/Nu22sgN) and the bot will then send you a message containing your ID.
